# learning-basic-machine-learning-by-dicoding
This project is proof that I have completed the "Learning Basic Machine Learning" program by Dicoding. in this project I am required to create an artificial neural network program using TensorFlow python. This program must also be able to recognize hand shapes that form scissors, stones, or paper.

Criteria met: 
-The dataset must be divided into train set and validation set.
-Must implement image augmentation.
-Use image data generator.
-The model must use a sequential model.
-Model training should not exceed 30 minutes.
-The program is run on Google Collaboratory.
-Accuracy of the model is at least 85%.
-Can predict images uploaded to Colab.
-Add personal data (according to the Dicoding profile) to the submission/project submitted.
