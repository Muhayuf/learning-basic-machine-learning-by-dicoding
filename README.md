# learning-basic-machine-learning-by-dicoding
This project is proof that I have completed the "Learning Basic Machine Learning" program by Dicoding. in this project I am required to create an artificial neural network program using TensorFlow python. This program must also be able to recognize hand shapes that form scissors, stones, or paper.
